Description: Fitrec is a hotspot among students. As the only gym in Boston University’s main campus, it is crowded quite often, making it insufficient for students to get a proper workout. Therefore, our project aims to analyze how different elements such as weather, day of time, and time of semester (e.g: first week of classes, midterm season, finals season, etc) affect people going to Fitrec. Using this information, we also plan to predict ultimately what’s the best time and day to visit the Fitrec.

Goals: 
Analyze what factors influence students’ visits to gym
Use the analysis and data to predict which time and days of the week is least busiest and thus most optimal for students to go to the gym

Data Collection: Design survey questions for a Google form - including questions about time and day of gym visits, duration of workouts, perceived crowdedness (give a scale of 1-5 or something numeric), outside factors influencing gym visits (exams, weather, etc). We then plan to spread the Google form by printing out QR codes and putting them around campus (Fitrec, GSU, CAS, etc) as well as through friends and social media. This will let us collect as much data as possible. 

Plans on modeling data: We plan to preprocess the data by cleaning and organizing the data, and encoding categorical variables. 

Plans on visualization: Design infographics summarizing key findings, such as busiest hours, least crowded days, and factors most influencing gym occupancy. Show visualizations in the form of scatter plots, histograms, etc using Matplot and other Python libraries

Test Plan: We plan to randomly shuffle our dataset and use 80% of our data for training, and 20% for testing.
